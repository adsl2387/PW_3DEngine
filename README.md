# PW_3DEngine Real Time Renderring
a simple program of 3d graphic renderring --zhangkai
# Software Renderring
This program is based on win32 application while using the  "setpixel" function to complete 3d graphic renderring.
It has realized world_transform,view_transform,perspective_transform of each object.
# Texture Mapping
liner filter mapping,biliner filter mapping ,nearest point mapping are supported.

# Off_line Renderring
It also has realized ray_trace renderring algorithm. When you run the application firstly you see the scene is based
on ray_trace renderring(also called path_trace or global lighting!)
